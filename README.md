This is a C++ wrapper for SQLite C API database engine.
It was written to simplify and speedup coding of local database access.

easySQLite was written and tested with Visual C++ 2010 Express, but is not using any nonstandard extensions, so should compile with any other C++ compiler.

Why easySQLite solution is better than others ?

  * elegant, objective solution
  * explicit naming and calling
  * uses exceptions or methods return values
  * clear, understandable usage
  * flexible and expandable
  * strongly tested (tests included)
  * Just take a look at sample code.
